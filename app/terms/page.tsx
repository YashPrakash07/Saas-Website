                        Our Annual, Half-Yearly, and Quarterly commitment plans offer a lower monthly rate compared to our month-to-month plans in exchange for a fixed commitment to our service.

                        Here’s how we calculate the fee: [List Price] - [Month-to-month rate of your plan] = Monthly savings amount. [Monthly savings amount] x [Number of months used] = Cancellation fee (plus tax, if applicable).
